I am Srishti. First year student at IIT Roorkee.
I'm from Jaipur, India(Timezone IST)
I have completed the Andrew NG Ml course on coursera and deeplearning specialization deeplearning.ai. I also know a bit of html and css.
I am interested in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and contributing to open source.
Even though I haven't previously contributed to open source, I look forward to doing it in the future. I have done a couple of Machine Learning projects on kaggle(Credit card fraud detection and Titanic problem) and a digit recognition problem on Kaggle as well.
